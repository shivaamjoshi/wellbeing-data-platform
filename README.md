# wellbeing-data-platform
This platform is designed to ingest daily activity and task-related data to provide honest and trustworthy feedback to the user.

The data primarily originates from the user’s mobile device and includes metrics such as steps, sleep, weight, and daily to-dos.

Due to the inherently inconsistent and evolving nature of human behavior, the data is expected to contain gaps, variations, and partial records.

Silent errors or unhandled inconsistencies are treated as critical failures, as they can lead to misleading feedback and incorrect long-term trend analysis.

For this reason, the platform prioritizes data correctness and transparency over immediacy.

##Design Principles
### Correctness Over Immediacy
The platform prioritizes accurate and explainable data over near-real-time updates. Delayed ingestion or incomplete data is considered acceptable and preferable to silently propagating incorrect or assumed values.

### Explicit Handling of Missing and Incomplete Data
Missing or incomplete data is treated as a first-class signal rather than being masked with default or placeholder values. The platform preserves data gaps explicitly to avoid misleading trends and to maintain the integrity of long-term insights.

### Fail Fast, Never Fail Silently
Silent failures are treated as critical defects, as exposing the user to incorrect data undermines trust in the feedback loop. Errors are surfaced explicitly, and the system is designed to halt processing rather than propagate misleading information.

### Schema Evolution Without Breaking Trust
Upstream schema changes are expected as data sources evolve over time. The platform explicitly detects and manages these changes, ensuring that trust and data integrity are preserved rather than sacrificed for short-term convenience.

### Config-Driven, Environment-Agnostic Behavior
The platform’s behavior is driven by configuration rather than code changes across environments. This approach reduces deployment risk and ensures consistent, reproducible behavior from development through production.

### Systems Are Built to Be Observed and Tested
Failures and unexpected behavior are anticipated rather than treated as anomalies. The platform is designed to be observable and verifiable through tests, ensuring that issues are detected early and prevented from reaching the user.
