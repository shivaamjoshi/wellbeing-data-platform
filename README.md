# wellbeing-data-platform
This platform is designed to ingest daily activity and task-related data to provide honest and trustworthy feedback to the user.

The data primarily originates from the user’s mobile device and includes metrics such as steps, sleep, weight, and daily to-dos.

Due to the inherently inconsistent and evolving nature of human behavior, the data is expected to contain gaps, variations, and partial records.

Silent errors or unhandled inconsistencies are treated as critical failures, as they can lead to misleading feedback and incorrect long-term trend analysis.

For this reason, the platform prioritizes data correctness and transparency over immediacy.
